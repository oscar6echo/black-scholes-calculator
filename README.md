See: <https://oscar6echo.github.io/black-scholes-calculator>

## Description

The [Black Scholes formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) gives the theoretical price of a simple vanilla call or put option based on a set of market parameters, as well as several derivatives of this price, known as the [Greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)).

This is a simple calculator [here](https://oscar6echo.github.io/black-scholes-calculator/) with a 2D / 3D viewer to help understand the sensitivities of such option price to the formula inputs.

Based on [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) for the 2D viewer, and [Almende graph3d](http://almende.github.io/chap-links-library/graph3d.html) for the 3D viewer.
